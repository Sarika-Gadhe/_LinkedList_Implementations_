# 📚 Combined Linked List Implementations

<p align="center">
  <b>All Linked List operations combined in a single file per language.</b><br>
  🖥️ C++ • ☕ Java
</p>

---

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains **all linked list operations implemented in a single file** for each language: C++ and Java.  
It includes **Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists** and all common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, search, and reversal.  

The combined files are **self-contained**, making it easier to **compile, run, and test all operations in one place**.  
This approach is ideal for **learning, coding practice, and interview preparation**.
